We decided to implement a FAT file system, simply because it is the supposedly easier one to implement. However, we found reading/writing across multiple blocks to be very difficult, in addition to truncating. 

When the disk is mounted, the VCB, Directory Entries, and FAT Entries are stored in memory, and written back to the disk when it is unmounted. This seemed like it would make things easier than doing a disk read or write for every operation. Of course, if the disk does not unmount properly, this will have unpleasant results. The file system is still very slow because no optimization was attempted. It was, for the most part, only tested with the test script.
